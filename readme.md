- Although I had made insane amount of `Web-pages` with `HTML` & `CSS` this felt like this was the most lenghty. I almost applied all my learnings into creating this one as the project demanded each and every container to be build using `flex-box`.

## Learnings

- I learnt how to `align-items:center` to leave some padding to left and some padding to right.
- Learnt how to break and solve one element at a time and not get overwhelmed by the size of the project.
- Also learnt how to make the `footer` element.
- Time Consumed to make this page **3 Hours 10 Minutes**.
